# FacePool

The goal of FacePool, is to create an attendance system using facial recognition technology. The project uses Python, Tkinter for the GUI, SQLite for storing user details, and OpenCV for face detection.

With FacePool, Students/Employees can register, by capturing their facial images and storing them along with their details in a database. During attendance, the system captures the faces of individuals and matches them with the registered images to mark their presence.

Other features in the project include displaying attendance data, deleting individuals from the database, and managing the attendance directory. Overall, FacePool provides a user-friendly interface for managing attendance using facial recognition technology.
